# Raspberry Pi Setup for BloomCircuit

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Raspberry Pi's role in the BloomCircuit project, detailing its communication with the NodeMCU and its interaction with MongoDB.

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi acts as an intermediary and data processing unit in the BloomCircuit project. It receives real-time soil moisture readings from the NodeMCU via WebSocket, processes this data, and subsequently updates a MongoDB database. This ensures that all sensor readings are stored and can be accessed for analysis, reporting, or other purposes.

## Flow and Functionality

1. **WebSocket Communication**: The Raspberry Pi maintains an active WebSocket server. The NodeMCU connects to this server and sends moisture readings in real-time.

2. **Data Processing**: Upon receiving data from the NodeMCU, the Raspberry Pi can perform any necessary processing or transformation on the data, preparing it for storage.

3. **MongoDB Interaction**: After processing, the Raspberry Pi updates the MongoDB database with the latest readings. This ensures a historical record of all moisture readings and allows for trend analysis, reporting, and other data-driven tasks.

## WebSocket Server

The Raspberry Pi runs a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections from the NodeMCU. This server is responsible for:

- Establishing and maintaining connections with the NodeMCU.
- Receiving and processing real-time data from the NodeMCU.
- Handling any errors or interruptions in the data stream.

## MongoDB Integration

The Raspberry Pi is configured to interact with a MongoDB instance. This involves:

- Establishing a connection to the MongoDB server.
- Inserting new readings into the appropriate collection.
- Ensuring data integrity and handling any database-related errors.

## Code

The code running on the Raspberry Pi manages several tasks:

- Running and maintaining the WebSocket server.
- Processing incoming data from the NodeMCU.
- Interacting with MongoDB to store the processed data.

## Getting Started

For new users looking to understand or work with the Raspberry Pi in the BloomCircuit project:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/).
2. Review the codebase to understand the WebSocket server implementation, data processing logic, and MongoDB interaction.
3. Ensure that the MongoDB instance is running, accessible, and properly configured.
4. Test the WebSocket communication with the NodeMCU to ensure real-time data transfer.

## Future Enhancements

As the BloomCircuit project evolves, there's potential to integrate more features on the Raspberry Pi side, such as data analytics, alert systems based on moisture levels, or integration with other databases or platforms.
